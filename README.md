# Input generator
Uses an artificial neural network to generate an input based on the absence or presence of a hidden state.

Estimating the Information Extracted by a Single Spiking Neuron from a Continuous Input Time Series. _Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience_, 11(June), 49. [doi:10.3389/FNCOM.2017.00049](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2017.00049)<br>Please cite this reference when using this method.

## Setup
The requirements.txt file contains the packages that have been used to run the code and determine chip layout. Install packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or by

conda install --file requirements.txt

## Usage
Specify your parameters like duration, mean firing rate and qon/qoff generator type in the main.py file.
Run "python main.py", to generate results (with the newest version installed as per requirements.txt). Alternative tweaks as the number of artificial neurons and kernel type van be adjusted in the code/make_input_experiments.py file.

## Structure
The repository is organised into x main folders. The root contains the main.py file, used to run the program.
* /code: Contains the classes and functions used in the program.

  - /classes: Contains the Input class used to generate an input
  - /functions: Contains the make_input_experiments function that creates the hiddenstate, input theory and input current.
* /results: Contains the input generated by main.py and a function plotter.py to quickly visualise it.

## Visualisation
Run "python results/plotter.py" to visualize some of the results.
